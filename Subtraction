6. Complement Accumulator (CMA)
Modify
-> Machine Ins
-> New
-> CMA
-> Opcode = E200
-> Type = Register-Reference
Implementation
-> Logical
-> Name: Note Not
-> AC ← AC' (1's Complement)
-> Type = Logical
-> Source 2 = AC
-> Destination = AC
Drag -> AC ← AC'
End

7. Increment Accumulator (INC)
Modify
-> Instructions
-> New
-> INC
-> Opcode = E020
-> Type = Register-Reference
Implementation
-> Arithmetic
-> Name: Increment (INCR)
-> INCR ← AC + 1
-> Source 1 = AC
-> Source 2 = 1 (Implicit/Constant)
-> Type = Addition
-> Dest = AC
Drag -> INCR ← AC and END (This implies AC is incremented, AC ← AC + 1)
